== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I output using a template tag? =
Of course! Just include `<?php echo do_shortcode( '[AuthorRecommendedPosts post_id="XXX"]' ); ?>` where *XXX* is the ID of the post, or you can leave it out if you include it in the loop. i.e. `<?php echo do_shortcode( '[AuthorRecommendedPosts]' ); ?>`

= I want to make it fit the style of my site better =
We left the styles pretty generic so it is simple enough to update to fit your theme style. Of course some CSS writing will be required.

= Is there a widget? =
At this time no, we want to add this in though. So keep your eyes peeled.

= Why did you make this? =
We did not really find any plugins out there that does just this. And we wanted something quick, simple, and easy to use.
